== General

The English is generally excellent but watch for use of "in case".  It doesn't
mean "in the case that", "when" or "if" which I think you mean (any of which
could replace it).  "In case" by iself means approximately "in order to prepare
for the possibility that..." - e.g. "In case it rains, I'll take my umbrella."

An overall diagram of a message including all the tags etc. would be useful,
as would binary examples / test vectors

== 2.1 Channel Message Header

Table isn't quite clear that octets 2 and 3 comprise the content identifier,
although the text makes this implicit

The CNL bitfield diagram has bit 0 as MSB (0x80).  Although I would draw it
that way round (MSB first) I would usually number 7 down to 0, and I had to
mentally do this to work out the Channel ID mask (0x3f).  Also other bitmaps
such as CFL.

== 2.2 Channel Configuration Header

Confused about the relationship between SCWC and the data configuration
(metadata) "tags".  SCWC says number of 32-bit configuration words but the
tags are defined as 16-bit headers with variable length structure.  It sounds
more like SCWC is referring to opaque private data but then I can't find any
count of configuration tags...


3.4.6 4/1 - draw control

Hint: What defines Format 0 or Format 1?
